# PowerPulse: Analyzing India'sEnergy Trends (2019-2020)

This project presents an in-depth analysis of electricity consumption across major Indian states during the years 2019 and 2020. It highlights consumption patterns, regional differences, seasonal variations, and the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on energy demand.  
(All insights are based on the project PDF.)

## Objectives

- Analyze state-wise monthly and daily electricity consumption.
- Identify patterns, seasonal trends, correlations, and demand fluctuations.
- Compare high-consumption states to understand regional differences.
- Provide insights to support energy planning and distribution strategies.

## Key Analyses and Findings

### 1. Energy Consumption Correlation
- Strong positive correlations among northern states like **Punjab**, **Haryana**, **Rajasthan**, and **Uttar Pradesh**.
- Some southern and northeastern states show opposite or weak correlation trends.
- Correlation with **Month** and **Day_of_Week** indicates seasonal and weekly impact on electricity usage.

### 2. Monthly Energy Consumption Across States
- **Maharashtra**, **Gujarat**, and **Uttar Pradesh** record the highest monthly consumption.
- **Sikkim**, **Mizoram**, **Nagaland**, and **Arunachal Pradesh** show the lowest energy usage.
- Visible seasonal fluctuations across multiple states throughout the year.

### 3. Comparison Between Five Major States
- **Maharashtra** consistently stays above 400 MW and leads in consumption.
- **Uttar Pradesh** shows high variability.
- **Punjab** and **Haryana** remain moderate and stable.
- **Delhi** records the lowest values among the major states.

### 4. State-Wise Energy Distribution
- Highest median values in **Maharashtra**, **Gujarat**, and **Tamil Nadu**.
- Lowest medians appear in **Mizoram**, **Nagaland**, and **Tripura**.
- Some states show large variations and outliers, indicating occasional demand spikes.

### 5. Monthly Consumption in West Bengal
- Highest consumption in **January**.
- Lowest consumption during **June and July**.
- Fairly stable usage from March to October.

### 6. Daily Energy Consumption Heatmap (West Bengal)
- High consumption days around **mid-August** and certain weekends.
- Low consumption mostly on **Sundays**.
- Greater fluctuations during summer and monsoon seasons.

### 7. Highest Energy-Consuming States
- **Maharashtra** ranks first in both average and peak consumption.
- **Gujarat** and **Uttar Pradesh** follow.
- **West Bengal** ranks at **11th** position overall.
